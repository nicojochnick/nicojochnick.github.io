  Abstract:


Quant Firm performance has slumped. The problem might not be the models, but the underlying data used to generate the models.

The Quant workflow is a product of three consecutive processes, data accumulation, data synthesis and strategy formulation. Even if the models that Quants generate and the resulting strategies are sound, they will still perform poorly if the data is not primary indicative of the variable they wish to measure - primarily the real value of an asset.

[Quant Workflow Model].

As the old adage goes: Garbage in, Garbage Out.


Firms are prone to over emphasize research efforts in modeling and tweaking, instead of finding the right data. Features that are considered less-quantifiable and agreeable with modern modeling techniques may provide the key for better analysis. An opportunity exists for the observant data miner to crawl non-traditional data sources in search of these “softer features”. For example, the quality and experience of a companies human capital has not been sufficiently factored into quant analysis even though websites like LinkedIn create an opportunity to publicly asses this value in real-time.
